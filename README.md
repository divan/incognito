# Incognito Color Scheme for Vim

I don't know origins of this theme. It's been in my setup for years.

By default, it has a dark gray background. Here are screenshots for both, dark and light themes.

## Installation

Copy the file on your .vim/colors folder.

Or if you're using Vundle or vim-plug, add this to your .vimrc:

**Vundle**:

  ```Plugin 'divan/incognito'```

**vim-plug**:

  ```Plug 'divan/incognito'```
